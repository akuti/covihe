                    As you can see from todays world senario, people are being afraid to go to hospitals and get helth support b/s of the covid pandemic.
                    and also doctors are under a lot of stress which arise due to the pandemic and also due to the large number of patints they are following.
                    and due to this most countries are pusing their helth system to online support by phone as one alternative.
